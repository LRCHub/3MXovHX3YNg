Some people say a man is made outta mud
A poor man's made outta muscle and blood
Muscle and blood and skin and bones
A mind That's a-weak and a back That's strong
You load sixteen tons, what do you get?
Another day older and deeper in debt
Saint Peter Don't you call me 'Cause I can't go
I owe my soul to the company store
I was born one mornin? when the sun didn't shine
I picked up my shovel and I walked to the mine
I loaded sixteen tons of number nine coal
And the straw boss said "Well, a-bless my soul"
You load sixteen tons, what do you get?
Another day older and deeper in debt
Saint Peter Don't you call me 'Cause I can't go
I owe my soul to the company store
I was born one mornin', it was drizzlin' rain
Fightin' and trouble are my middle name
I was raised in the canebrake by an old mama
lion
CAin't no-a high-toned woman make me walk the
line
You load sixteen tons, what do you get?
Another day older and deeper in debt
Saint Peter Don't you call me 'Cause I can't go
I owe my soul to the company store
If you see me comin?, better step aside
A lotta men didn't, a lotta men died
One fist of iron, the other of steel
If the right one Don't a-get you, then the left
one will
You load sixteen tons, what do you get?
Another day older and deeper in debt
Saint Peter Don't you call me 'Cause I can't go
I owe my soul to the company store

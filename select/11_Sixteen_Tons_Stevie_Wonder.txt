Some folks say a man is made out of mud
But a poor man's made out of muscle and blood
Muscle and blood, skin and bones
A mind that's weak and a back that's strong, yeh

You load 16 tons and what do you get
Another day older and deeper in debt
Saint Peter don't you call me, 'cause I can't go
I owe my soul to the company store, yeah, ha

I was born when the sun didn't shine
I became a man who who would work the mine
I loaded 16 tons of number nine coal
The foreman said, "Well, a-bless my soul"

I was born in drizzling rain
Fighting and trouble was my middle name
When I come around, you better step aside
A lot of men didn't and a lot man died
Yes they did

You load 16 tons and what do you get
Another day older and deeper in debt
Saint Peter don't you call me, 'cause I can't go
I owe my soul to the company store
(Yes sing it one time with me)

16 tons and what do you get
Another day older and deeper in debt
Saint Peter don't you call me, 'cause I can't go
I owe my soul to the company store

Everybody humming only
Mmm, hmm, hmm, hmm, yeah
Mmm, hmm, hmm, hmm

Some people say a man is made outta mud
A poor man's made outta muscle and blood
Muscle and blood, and skin and bone
A mind that's a-weak and a back that's strong

You load 16 tons, and what do you gain?
Another day older and deeper in debt
Saint Peter, don't you call me 'cause I can't go
I owe my soul to the company store

I was born one mornin' when the sun didn't shine
I picked up my shovel and I walked to the mine
I loaded 16 tons of number nine coal
And the straw boss said, "Well, a-bless my soul"

You load 16 tons, and what do you gain?
Another day older and deeper in debt
Saint Peter, don't you call me 'cause I can't go
I owe my soul to the company store

If you see me comin', better step aside
A lotta men didn't, and a lotta men died
One fist of iron, the other of steel
If the right one don't a-get you, then the left one will

You load 16 tons, and what do you gain?
Another day older and deeper in debt
Saint Peter, don't you call me 'cause I can't go
I owe my soul to the company store

I was born one mornin', and it was drizzlin' rain
Fightin' and trouble are my middle name
I was raised in the canebrake by an ol' mama lion
Ain't no-a high-toned woman make me walk the line

You load 16 tons, and what do you gain?
Another day older and deeper in debt
Saint Peter, don't you call me 'cause I can't go
I owe my soul to the company store
